# Email Agents 

## Environment Setup 

### Python Version

* Ensure you're using Python 3.11 or later. 
* This version is required for optimal compatibility with LangGraph. 

```shell
python3 --version
```

### API Keys

* If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can sign up [here](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/).
* Sign up for LangSmith [here](https://smith.langchain.com/).
* Generate a LangSmith API key.

### Set Environment Variables

* Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```shell
# Copy the .env.example file to .env
cp .env.example .env
```

* Edit the `.env` file with the following:
```shell
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="interrupt-workshop"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

* You can also set the environment variables in your terminal:
```shell
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Package Installation

**Recommended: Using uv (faster and more reliable)**

```shell
# Install uv if you haven't already
pip install uv

# Install the package with development dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Alternative: Using pip**

```shell
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# Ensure you have a recent version of pip (required for editable installs with pyproject.toml)
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# Install the package in editable mode
$ pip install -e .
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do not skip the package installation step! This editable install is **required** for the notebooks to work correctly. The package is installed as `interrupt_workshop` with import name `email_assistant`, allowing you to import from anywhere with `from email_assistant import ...`

## Structure 

The repo is organized into the 4 sections, with a notebook for each and accompanying code in the `src/email_assistant` directory.




### Gmail Integration and Deployment

Set up Google API credentials following the instructions in [Gmail Tools README](src/email_assistant/tools/gmail/README.md).

The README also explains how to deploy the graph to LangGraph Platform.

The full implementation of the Gmail integration is in [src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py).

## Running Tests

The repository includes an automated test suite to evaluate the email assistant. 

Tests verify correct tool usage and response quality using LangSmith for tracking.

### Running Tests with [run_all_tests.py](/tests/run_all_tests.py)

```shell
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

### Test Results

Test results are logged to LangSmith under the project name specified in your `.env` file (`LANGSMITH_PROJECT`). This provides:
- Visual inspection of agent traces
- Detailed evaluation metrics
- Comparison of different agent implementations

### Available Test Implementations

The available implementations for testing are:
- `email_assistant` -  email assistant

### Testing Notebooks

You can also run tests to verify all notebooks execute without errors:

```shell

# Or run via pytest
pytest tests/test_notebooks.py -v
```

## Future Extensions

Add [LangMem](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langmem/) to manage memories:
* Manage a collection of background memories. 
* Add memory tools that can look up facts in the background memories.
